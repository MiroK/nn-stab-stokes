# Methodology

 - [ ] What does the learned operator look like/properties?
 - [ ] Say we learn on one-few resolutions and fixed example (think bcs in Stokes); does that stab help in other resulutions/examples?
 - [ ] Are we learning some stabilization?
 - [ ] PDE cstr literature on problems we're looking at - one shot?

# Infrastructure
 - [ ] Keras like spec of the NN model with possibility to set(init) weights, store/load model
 - [ ] Stability testing
